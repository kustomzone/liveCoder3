  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>It’s been nearly a month since I started publishing <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">“One threex a day” challenge</a>. The idea was to share with you the many <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extensions</a> that I had written over time. I wanted to show you how they could be useful, fun and easy to include in your very own three.js game. I came up with a motto “One threex a day gets your game on its way”. I was all set up and ready to go. This was a challenge inspired by John Resig’s article called <a href="http://ejohn.org/blo!/write-code-every-day/">“Write code everyday”</a>. I deeply agree with his theory for making progress, increasing productivity and getting the work done. I wished to try something similar on myself.</p>

<p>Let me tell you though… it WAS challenging! Keeping the publication rhythm was hard. It takes a lot of discipline and organization to get it done everyday. I had the best intentions, but unfortunately I got sick and I felt bad for most of last week. Additionally I had some day work on the side that I needed to get done. At this rate of publication, it was very hard to keep up! At first I wanted to publish the threex extensions for a period of two months but I think it is best to rest for a while. So a week ago I published the last three.js game extension of phase 1.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">

<p>Hello everybody! This is my first <em>Three.js Interview</em> video. The inspiration came from all those great people out there doing <a href="http://threejs.org/">very cool projects with three.js</a>. I want to share their innovations with others. If you know me, you know that I love talking about three.js. So, I would like everybody to have the opportunity to enjoy and learn from these <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/categories/threejsInterview/">three.js interviews</a>. So three.js interviews are videos of around one hour where people are talking about cool things they do with three.js . Maybe you could get some ideas for your own project or simply partake on a subject you’re passionate about.</p>


<p>The idea is to have interesting people come and talk about cool things that they’ve done with three.js. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/BenAtExocortex">Ben Houston</a>, who is our guest in this first video. Ben is the Team Leader for <a href="http://clara.io/">Clara.io</a>, a online 3D modeling and rendering tool that you can use inside you browser. Ben talks to us about the creation and the evolution of <a href="http://clara.io/">Clara.io</a> and about all the interesting features it’s got!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it and stay tuned for the next Three.js Interview :)</p>
